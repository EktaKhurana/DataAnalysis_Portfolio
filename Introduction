Welcome,

I've created this repository to highlight my Data Analysis and BI Developer experience earned in the last 4 years.
I have working exposure to various technologies/tools like Qlik Sense, Power BI , SAP , BigQuery, Excel , Google sheets, Jira and Python.

Some of these projects are based on work I've done as a data analyst, while others are based on tutorials or textbook examples.
When posting a script based on a tutorial, I've included a note about it.
